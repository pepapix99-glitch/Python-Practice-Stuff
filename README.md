# Python-Practice-Stuff
Sup, Pix here! I just made this repo to upload my practice stuff here in github as form of personal documentation of my python progress.
Feel free to check my stuff out, Im open to suggestions and tips as am just trying to learn the language myself. 
If you wanna use my stuff to learn python as well and I have the stuff you're curious about, go right ahead n see if I have it. Just a fellow potato learning robot blabber.
